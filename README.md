* Complete Project Build:
	This project will have 3 different APIs that will be called upon.  Each API will have a slightly increased level of difficulty to incorporate into solving, such as the first will not require a key, another will, and the third will need referencing.  Within this project, students will need to fix bugs withing the HTML, CSS, and JS files that are provided.  By the end of the project, they will have a completed app built that will allow them to search a location (by city) to display weather details in a card, three random restaurant locations, if applicable, display if those results don't appear, and generate a random quote at the bottom of the page.

* What this Challenge expects:
	API Keys are still new concepts but it should be understood that they exist and what, generally, how they are used.  Students will be expected to obtain their own FREE API Keys to incorporate into this project in order to get it to work.  This particular build has the keys stored into a keys.js file that has been tagged in the .gitignore so they do not exist in ANY way within the project.  Students can either set their keys within each respected script file or house them in a stored file like this current build.

* What this Challenge is NOT meant to be:
	As much as we all want to make beautiful pages, the focus of this is to practice debugging and working with outside APIs.  Because no two API docs are built the same, it's important to seek out solutions to our specific problems regarding these aspects.

* What SHOULD NOT be altered:
	Although this is a small "playground" to tinker in, there are two main things that should NOT be altered.  This is the MODAL and ASSETS Folder.  No issues will be housed within these branches of code / file names.  However, this doesn't mean that naming conventions may have issues elsewhere in other files.
